# Supply Chain & Automated Payment Collection

This project is a decentralized supply chain solution built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for automated dispatch of goods upon payment and enables payment collection without intermediaries.

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Supply Chain Solution**: This project can be a key component of a supply chain management system, offering transparency and trust through blockchain technology.

- **Automated Dispatch**: Goods are dispatched automatically upon payment confirmation, reducing manual interventions and streamlining the process.

- **Payment Collection**: The project facilitates payment collection directly between the buyer and seller without the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and delays.

## Development Goals

The primary development goals of this project include:

- **Showcasing Event Triggers**: Utilizing Ethereum smart contract events to trigger actions and update the supply chain state.

- **Understanding Low-Level Functions**: Demonstrating the use of the low-level function `address.call.value()()` for secure payment handling.

- **Workflow with Truffle**: Providing insights into using the Truffle framework for Ethereum smart contract development and testing.

- **Unit Testing with Truffle**: Implementing unit tests for the smart contracts to ensure their reliability and correctness.

- **Events in HTML**: Displaying events emitted by the smart contracts on a web interface using HTML.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `contracts/`: Contains the Ethereum smart contracts.

- `migrations/`: Migration scripts for deploying contracts.

- `test/`: Unit tests for smart contracts.

- `client/`: Frontend web application for interacting with the contracts.
